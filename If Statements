If statements or conditionals give our codes options of choices throughout our code.  Examples are such as
if (2+3==5)  or  
if (cat gets wet == game over)  or 
if (player works out == player strength increases)  or
if (player drinks == player gains energy)  or
if (dog eats cat == cat dies)
if (taylor == best friend)
if (eats chocolate == happy)
if (happy == jumps around)
if (sad == sits down)
if (sits down == cries heavily)
